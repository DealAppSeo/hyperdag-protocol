# Contributing to the AI Trinity Symphony & HyperDAG Ecosystem 🤝

Thank you for choosing to contribute to the future of decentralized, ethical AI! We are building an ecosystem that thrives on collaboration and shared truth.

## 🌈 The Ecosystem Philosophy: "Co-opetition"

We believe that fragmentation is the enemy of progress. Instead of cloning a repo and starting a separate silo, we encourage you to:
1.  **Build On Top**: Use our core primitives (EIP-8004, RepID) to power your own agents or apps.
2.  **Shared Reputation**: By building in the ecosystem, your agents benefit from a unified, verified reputation score across all participating platforms.
3.  **Ethical Anchoring**: All contributions are expected to align with the **Trinity Constitution** (Honor, Justice, Truth, Excellence).

## 📂 Repository Breakdown
- **[hyperdag-protocol](https://github.com/DealAppSeo/hyperdag-protocol)**: Core Web3 foundations. Focus here if you are working on smart contracts, ZK-circuits, or protocol standards.
- **[hyperdag-platform](https://github.com/DealAppSeo/hyperdag-platform)**: AI Orchestration. Focus here if you are building agents, UI features, or bridging logic.

## 🛠 Getting Started

### 📝 Code Standards
- **Truth over Hype**: Documentation must accurately reflect implementation.
- **Security First**: All Web3 code must consider ZKP privacy and owner-locked SBT patterns.
- **Modularity**: Build for the ecosystem. If you create a new agent skill, make it reusable.

### 🚀 Submission Process
1.  **Open an Issue**: Discuss your proposed change before writing code.
2.  **Dual-Repo Sync**: If your change affects both the protocol and the platform, ensure you open PRs in both repos with cross-references.
3.  **Peer Verification**: All contributions are verified by our agent swarm (Sophia/Nexus) and human maintainers.

## 🏛 Governance
Major protocol changes are governed by the **Three-Chamber DAO**.
- **Human Chamber**: Strategic alignment.
- **Agent Chamber**: Data-driven efficiency analysis.
- **Ecosystem Chamber**: Ethical compliance and sustainability.

## Vision: Help People Help People
We are building a democratized, individual-owned agentic AI ecosystem. Our community keeps corporate gatekeepers accountable. 

## Our Development Process
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all logic.
- Follow the Trinity Constitution (Phil 4:8) in your logic and comments.
- Keep components modular and extensible.

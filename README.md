# HyperDAG Protocol Core 🌐

> **Foundational Infrastructure for EIP-8004 Identity and Universal ZKP RepID**

HyperDAG Protocol is the Web3 source of truth for the **AI Trinity Symphony** ecosystem. We provide the decentralized primitives for sovereign agent identity and a **Universal ZKP RepID System** that promotes agents (both human and digital) who **help people help people**.

## 🕊️ Mission: Help People Help People
We are building a democratized, safe, and ethical AI layer that empowers every "ImageBearer" to act with agency and honor. We seek alignment with those who believe that AI should serve humanity's highest calling.

### 📜 Basis for Truth
Our protocol is grounded in **Philippians 4:8** and **Micah 6:8**. By building a system that rewards truth, honor, and justice, we enable a global co-opetition model where developers build on shared, audited foundations rather than competing for control.

## 🏗️ Integrated Tech Stack
HyperDAG Protocol works in tandem with the **[hyperdag-platform-robust](https://github.com/DealAppSeo/hyperdag-platform-robust)** and the **[trinity-ecosystem](https://github.com/DealAppSeo/trinity-ecosystem)** to deliver:

- **EIP-8004 Identity Adapters**: Sovereign adapters for SBT, DBT, and CBT (Charity Bound) tokens.
- **Universal ZKP RepID**: Privacy-preserving, mathematical reputation scores using **Pedersen Commitments** and ZK-SNARKs.
- **HyperDAG Architecture**: A high-efficiency directed acyclic graph designed for asynchronous, agent-led consensus.
- **BFT 3x3+3 Governance**: A multi-chamber DAO structure where agents validate agents and humans provide the final check and balance.
- **Patent-Pending GNN**: Trust scaling foundations protected for the people, by the people.

## 🤝 Build with Us
Instead of forking to compete, we invite you to build on top of our shared protocol. By leveraging the **Trinary Learning Model** (People-Agent-People), we can scale impact to the "last, lost, and least" with high-integrity, quantum-hardened communication.

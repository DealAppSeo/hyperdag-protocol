# HyperDAG Protocol Core 🌐

> **Foundational Infrastructure for EIP-8004 Identity and Reputation**

HyperDAG Protocol is the Web3 core of the **AI Trinity Symphony** ecosystem. We provide the decentralized primitives for sovereign agent identity and the **Universal ZKP RepID System** that promotes agents (both human and digital) who **help people help people**.

## 🕊️ Mission: Ethical "Co-opetition"
Instead of siloed competition, HyperDAG enables a unified, privacy-preserving reputation layer. We encourage developers to build on these foundations to ensure AI serves humanity with honor, truth, and justice.

## 🏗 Dual-Repo Strategy
HyperDAG operates in a dual-repo model to ensure clean separation between protocol-level truth and application-level orchestration:
- **hyperdag-protocol** (This Repo): The source of truth. Smart contracts, ZK-circuits, and protocol standards.
- **[hyperdag-platform](https://github.com/DealAppSeo/hyperdag-platform)**: The AI engine. Agent orchestration, swarm management, and the Web3-bridge.

## 🚀 Key Features (Phase 0)

### 🆔 EIP-8004 Identity Adapter
A compliant Identity Registry supporting the triad of token types:
- **SBT (Soul Bound)**: Permanent, non-transferable human/agent identity.
- **DBT (Digital Bound)**: Ephemeral digital assets and credentials.
- **CBT (Charity Bound)**: Non-profit and impact-focused verified identities.

### 🛡 Privacy-Preserving Reputation (RepID)
- **Pedersen Commitments**: Cloaking reputation scores while allowing for mathematical verification.
- **x402 Payment Proofs**: First-class integration for payment-verified feedback (carrying 2x reputation weight).
- **Tiered System**: Evolutionary path from *Seedling* to *Canopy*.

### ⚖️ Three-Chamber Governance
A balanced 2-of-3 multi-chamber DAO model:
- 🧑‍💻 **Human Chamber** (Strategic Intent)
- 🤖 **Agent Chamber** (Operational Efficiency)
- 🌍 **Ecosystem Chamber** (Sustainability & Ethics)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Architecture**: Nx Monorepo
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Foundry/Hardhat)
- **Privacy**: Circom (ZK-SNARKs)
- **Standards**: EIP-8004, EIP-712, x402

## 🤝 Join the Dev Ecosystem

We believe in **co-opetition** over fragmentation. Instead of forking and splitting the protocol, we encourage developers to build on top of the shared HyperDAG foundations.

### Why Contribute?
- **Interoperability**: Build apps that leverage a unified agent reputation score across the entire ecosystem.
- **Security**: Benefit from audited, ethics-grounded smart contract primitives based on the **Trinity Constitution**.
- **Scale**: Plug into the AI Trinity Symphony orchestration layer for cross-chain execution.

### How to Get Involved
1. Check the `packages/contracts` and `packages/circuits` for current implementations.
2. Join our community discussions on [HyperDAG Discord/Telegram].
3. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for technical guidelines.

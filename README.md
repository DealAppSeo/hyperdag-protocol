> **Foundational Infrastructure for EIP-8004 Identity and Universal ZKP RepID**

HyperDAG Protocol is the Web3 source of truth for the **AI Trinity Symphony** ecosystem. We provide the decentralized primitives for sovereign agent identity and a **Universal ZKP RepID System** that promotes agents (both human and digital) who **help people help people**.

## 🕊️ Mission: Ethical Co-opetition
We are building a democratized, safe, and ethical AI layer. We seek alignment with those who believe that AI should serve humanity's highest calling, grounded in **Philippians 4:8** and **Micah 6:8**.
